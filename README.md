Domain-specific LLM workflows for scientific publishing and editorial QA
This repository contains domain-specific LLM workflows designed to support scientific editorial processes, including manuscript pre-review, quality checks,journal selection, and formal correspondence.

The project focuses on **workflow design and decision logic**, not on raw model training.

## Included tools
- **Stage 1 – Pre-review screening**  
  Scope fit, structure (IMRAD), citation sanity checks, editorial red flags.

- **Stage 2 – Deep editorial support**  
  Language refinement, structural consistency, clarity improvements.

- **Stage 3 – Format and compliance checks**  
  Journal requirements, references, figure/table consistency.

- **JournalFinder**  
  Journal matching based on discipline, scope, and formal criteria.

- **SciMailTranslator**  
  Formal scientific correspondence translation.
